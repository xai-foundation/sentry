# Hard Reset the Operator

If you need to do a hard reset on the operator or to have a clean new installation, you have to delete the files associated with the operator. Delete these files and then start the operator again.

Where to find the files:

On Windows:
```
• C:\Users\User\.sentry-operator
• C:\Users\User\sentry-node-config.json
• C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Xai Sentry Node
```
