- You are not purchasing, obtaining, accessing or using the Node Software on behalf of a U.S. Person or Restricted
  Person.


- Identity Verification. You will be required to provide information to us for the purposes of identity verification
  before you will be able to claim and take possession of any Xai Network cryptographic tokens (“**Xai Tokens**”) earned
  as Network Rewards (defined below) in connection with the Node Software. If we are unable to verify your identity and
  confirm that you are eligible to use the Node Software, you will not be permitted to use the Node Software, including
  to earn any Network Rewards. You agree to provide us with the information we request for purposes of identity
  verification and permit us to keep a record of such information. You further represent and agree that all such
  information is complete and accurate and that you will immediately notify the Company in the event that any
  information provided to the Company during this process is no longer complete or accurate.

### Node Software.

- Use of Node. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you may use the Node Software to operate a Xai
  Network sentry node on one or more machines that you own or control. The Xai Network is a “layer-3” network that
  operates on top of the Arbitrum One “layer-2” network, which operates on top of the “layer-1” Ethereum blockchain. As
  a sentry node operator, you will be able to help ensure that the correct state of the Xai Network is reflected on the
  Ethereum blockchain by reading assertion data from the rollup protocol on the “layer-2” network, submitting state
  roots of upcoming assertions to confirm the accuracy of information being submitted by sentry nodes on the Xai
  Network, and utilizing a Wallet (defined below) to perform assertion checks on the “layer-2” network. Use of Arbitrum
  One and Ethereum is subject to separate third-party terms and conditions. Please review the Arbitrum
  One (https://arbitrum.foundation/tos) and Ethereum (https://ethereum.org/en/terms-of-use/) terms and conditions
  carefully before using the Node Software.


- Key Requirement. You must purchase a Key from the Company in order to stake Xai Tokens and earn Network Rewards (
  defined below). The Key is a non-transferable non-fungible token. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
  Agreement, the Key will upgrade your Node Software and allow you to stake Xai Tokens using a single Xai Network sentry
  node on a machine you own or control. You must purchase additional Keys to stake Xai Tokens using multiple Xai Network
  sentry nodes. You may purchase a Key at https://sentry.xai.games/. You will be required to provide information to the
  Company for purposes of verifying your identity and confirming that you are eligible to earn Network Rewards in order
  to claim and take possession of any Xai Tokens earned as Network Rewards.


- Connecting a Digital Wallet. In order to operate a sentry node using the Node Software, you will need to connect a
  compatible third-party Ethereum blockchain digital wallet (“**Wallet**”). You are solely responsible for maintaining
  the security of your Wallet, including any associated credentials, private key and seed phrase. The Company does not
  offer Wallet software or custody Xai Tokens (or any other crypto assets) on behalf of Node Software users. Your use of
  a third-party Wallet is subject to separate terms and conditions established by the Wallet provider.


- Network Rewards; Slashing. You may receive units of Xai Tokens from the Xai Network as a reward for contributing to
  the security of the Xai Network (“**Network Rewards**”). All such Network Rewards are programmatically distributed to
  sentry node operators by the Xai Network. Xai Tokens will accrue on the “layer-2” Arbitrum One network and can be
  “bridged” or transferred to the Xai Network through a Xai Network bridge for use on the Xai Network. Additionally,
  some or all of your staked Xai Tokens may be programmatically destroyed as a penalty imposed by the Xai Network  (a “*
  *Slashing Penalty**”) in certain instances. Please refer to the Xai Network documentation for more details. The
  Company is not responsible or liable for any Network Rewards or Slashing Penalties that result from your use of the
  Node Software. The Company shall not be liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your Wallet or as a
  result of any cyber incident or security vulnerability that impacts your Wallet. You will be required to provide
  information to the Company for purposes of verifying your identity and confirming that you are eligible to earn
  Network Rewards before you will be permitted to claim and take possession of any Xai Tokens earned as Network Rewards.


- Expiration of Network Rewards. Network Rewards can be claimed at any time prior to expiration. You will have [] days
  from the date that you earn a Network Reward to claim the Xai Tokens earned as part of the Network Reward before the
  Network Reward expires. You will be required to provide information to the Company for purposes of verifying your
  identity and confirming your eligibility to earn Network Rewards before you will be permitted to claim and take
  possession of any Xai Tokens earned as Network Rewards.


- Node Software Updates. The Node Software may automatically download or prompt you to download and install updates onto
  your machine from time to time. By accessing or using the Node Software, you agree that the Company may download and
  install automatic Node Software updates onto your machine. You may opt out of automatic updates by adjusting your Node
  Software settings.

### License Uses and Restrictions.

### Dispute Resolution; Agreement to Arbitrate.

- All disputes, claims and controversies, whether based on past, present or future events, arising out of or relating to
  statutory or common law claims, the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of any provision of
  the Agreement, and the determination of the scope or applicability of your agreement to arbitrate any dispute, claim
  or controversy originating from the Agreement, will be determined by binding arbitration in Tortola, the British
  Virgin Islands pursuant to the BVI IAC Arbitration Rules, before a single arbitrator.


- The arbitrator will apply the substantive law of the British Virgin Islands, excluding its conflict or choice of law
  rules.


- Nothing in the Agreement will preclude the parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a
  court of appropriate jurisdiction.


- A party must notify the other party of its intent to commence arbitration prior to commencing arbitration. The notice
  must specify the date on which the arbitration demand is intended to be filed, which must be at least thirty (30) days
  after the date of the notice. During this time period, the parties will meet for the purpose of resolving the dispute
  prior to commencing arbitration.


- Subject to Section 8.4, each party may commence arbitration by providing to the BVI International Arbitration Centre
  and the other party to the dispute a written demand for arbitration, stating the subject of the dispute and the relief
  requested.


- Subject to the disclaimers and limitations of liability stated in the Agreement, the appointed arbitrators may award
  monetary damages and any other remedies allowed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands (including the BVI IAC
  Arbitration Rules). In making a determination, the arbitrator will not have the authority to modify any term of the
  Agreement. The arbitrator will deliver a reasoned, written decision with respect to the dispute to each party, who
  will promptly act in accordance with the arbitrator’s decision. Any award (including interim or final remedies) may be
  confirmed in or enforced by a state or federal court located in the British Virgin Islands. The decision of the
  arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, and will not be subject to appeal or review.


- The party initiating the arbitration is responsible for paying the applicable filing fee. Each party will advance
  one-half of the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, the costs of the attendance of the arbitration reporter at the
  arbitration hearing and the costs of the arbitration facility. In any arbitration arising out of or relating to the
  Agreement, the arbitrator will award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably
  incurred by the prevailing party in connection with those aspects of its claims or defenses on which it prevails, and
  any opposing awards of costs and legal fees awards will be offset.


- The parties will keep confidential the existence of the arbitration, the arbitration proceeding, the hearing and the
  arbitrator’s decision, except (a) as necessary to prepare for and conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits; (b)
  in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or confirmation of an arbitrator’s decision or its
  enforcement; (c) the Company may disclose the arbitrator’s decision in confidential settlement negotiations; (d) each
  party may disclose as necessary to professional advisors that are subject to a strict duty of confidentiality; and (e)
  as applicable law otherwise requires. The parties, witnesses and arbitrator will treat as confidential and will not
  disclose to any third person (other than witnesses or experts) any documentary or other evidence produced in any
  arbitration, except as applicable so requires or if the evidence was obtained from the public domain or was otherwise
  obtained independently from the arbitration.


- In the case of a conflict between the provisions of this Section 8 and the BVI IAC Arbitration Rules, the provisions
  of this Section 8 shall prevail.


- To the extent permitted by applicable law, any dispute arising out of or relating to the Agreement, whether in
  arbitration or in court, shall be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or
  representative action. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or the BVI IAC Arbitration Rules, disputes
  regarding the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of this class waiver may be resolved only by a court and
  not by an arbitrator. If this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither
  party is entitled to arbitration.


- If for any reason a claim or dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, each party knowingly and
  irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to
  the Agreement..

### Term; Termination.

- The Agreement is effective beginning when you accept the Agreement or first access or use the Node Software and ending
  when terminated as set forth in Section 9.2.


- Your right to use and access the Node Software will automatically terminate in the event you fail to comply with any
  of the terms and conditions of the Agreement. Termination will be effective without notice.

  to the Website. You shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any modifications or revisions. You
  waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such modifications or revisions. Purchasing, obtaining,
  accessing or using the Node Software constitutes your acceptance of the Agreement as modified or revised. If you do
  not agree to the Agreement then in effect, you must immediately discontinue access to, and use of, the Node Software.


- Waivers. For a waiver to be deemed effective, a waiver must be in a writing signed by the waiving party. The failure
  of either party to enforce any provision of the Agreement will not constitute a waiver of that party’s rights to
  subsequently enforce the provision.


- Cumulative Rights; Injunctions. The rights and remedies of the parties under the Agreement are cumulative, and each
  party may exercise any of its rights and enforce any of its remedies under the Agreement, along with all other rights
  and remedies available to it at law, in equity or otherwise. Any material breach by a party of the Agreement could
  cause the non-breaching party irreparable harm for which the non-breaching party has no adequate remedies at law.
  Accordingly, the non-breaching party is entitled to seek specific performance or injunctive relief for any such
  breach.


- Severability. If any provision of these the Agreement is declared to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court
  of competent jurisdiction, then the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein
  shall not be affected thereby and the remainder of the provisions of the Agreement shall remain valid, legal and
  enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.


- Force Majeure. The Company shall have no liability for any failure or delay resulting from any condition beyond our

  disturbances.


- Successors and Assigns. You may not transfer or assign the Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder, by
  operation of law or otherwise and any such attempted assignment shall be void. The Company reserves the right to
  freely transfer or assign the Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder to any third party at any time
  without your consent and prior notice to you. If you object to any such transfer or assignment, you may stop using the
  Node Software.


- Relationship of the Parties. Nothing contained in the Agreement shall constitute you and the Company as members of any
  partnership, joint venture, association, syndicate, unincorporated business or similar assignment as a result of or by
  virtue of the relationship established by the Agreement.


- Governing Law. The Agreement shall be solely and exclusively governed, construed and enforced in accordance with the
  laws of the British Virgin Islands without giving effect to conflict of law rules or principles that would cause the
  application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.


- Entire Agreement. The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and the Company, and
  supersedes all previous communications, representations or agreements, whether written or oral, with respect to the
  subject matter hereof.


- No Third-Party Beneficiaries. The Agreement is not intended and shall not be construed to create any rights or
  remedies in any parties other than you and the Company and other Company affiliates, which each shall be a third-party
  beneficiary of the Agreement, and no other person shall assert any rights as a third-party beneficiary hereunder.
