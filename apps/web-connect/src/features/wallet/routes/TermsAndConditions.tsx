				<p><strong>1.2. <u>Identity Verification</u>.</strong> We reserve the right to request
					that you provide
					information
					to us for the purposes of verifying your identity. If we are unable to verify your identity and
					confirm
					that you are eligible to claim, access, or use the Tokens, you will not be permitted to claim,
					access,
					or use the Tokens. Upon request, you agree to provide us with the information we request for

				<h3><b>2. Claiming Airdrops</b></h3>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>
					2.1. <u>Airdrops</u>. We may from time to time distribute to Xai Network users the
					right to claim promotional Tokens as part of an “airdrop” (each, an “<b>Airdrop</b>”). Tokens
					distributed to users as part of an Airdrop will not automatically accrue to users’ digital wallets.
					Each
					user will be required to claim the Airdrop by visiting <a
					className="text-[#F30919]"
					href={"https://sentry.xai.games/#/claim-token"}>https://sentry.xai.games/#/claim-token</a> and
					following
					the instructions provided on the webpage,
					including paying associated Xai Network and Ethereum network transaction fees.
				</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>2.2. <u>Connecting a Digital Wallet</u>. In order to claim any
					Tokens granted in the
					Airdrop,
					you will need to connect a compatible third-party Ethereum blockchain digital wallet (“<b>Wallet</b>”).
					You are
					solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Wallet, including any associated
					credentials,
					private key, and seed phrase. The Company does not offer Wallet software or custody Tokens (or any
					other
					crypto assets) on behalf of users. Your use of a third-party Wallet is subject to separate terms and
					conditions established by the Wallet provider.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>2.3. <u>Expiration of Airdrops</u>. Airdrops can be claimed at any
					time prior to
					expiration.
					You will have 180 days from the date that you receive an Airdrop to claim the Tokens earned as part
					of
					the Airdrop before the Airdrop expires. You may be required to provide information to the Company
					for
					purposes of verifying your identity and confirming your eligibility to claim Airdrops before you
					will be
					permitted to claim and take possession of any Tokens.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h3><b>3. Risks</b></h3>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>3.1. You acknowledge that the Tokens and Xai Network incorporate
					experimental and novel
					technology and that the use of such technology involves a high degree of risk. For example, there
					are
					numerous reasons the Tokens or Xai Network could fail in an unexpected way, resulting in the total
					and
					absolute loss of your Tokens. You hereby agree that you assume all risks in connection with your use
					of
					the Tokens and Xai Network and expressly waive and release the Company from any and all liability,
					claims, causes of action, or damages arising out of or in any way relating to you obtaining or using
					Tokens and Xai Network.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>3.2. You understand and accept the risk of operational challenges related to
					the Tokens and Xai
					Network. For example, the Xai Network may experience cyber-attacks, unexpected surges in transaction
					volume or activity, or other operational or technical difficulties or vulnerabilities that may cause
					interruptions related to your use of the Tokens or Xai Network. You agree to accept the risk of
					Tokens
					or Xai Network failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties or
					vulnerabilities, including those resulting from cyber-attacks. You agree not to hold the Company
					accountable for any related losses.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>3.3. You agree that the Company is not responsible for any Tokens or other
					crypto assets that you
					receive, transfer, hold, stake, lose, or otherwise use or misuse in connection with the Xai
					Network.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>3.4. Legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the use of the Tokens
					may vary from
					jurisdiction to jurisdiction. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for
					evaluating
					the legality of using the Tokens in your jurisdiction. The Company is not responsible for
					determining
					whether or which laws and regulations may apply to you or your use of the Tokens.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h3><b>4. Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability</b>
				</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>4.1. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, THE TOKENS AND XAI NETWORK ARE
					ISSUED ON AN “AS-IS”
					AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO SUCH “AS-IS”
					AND
					“AS AVAILABLE” BASIS OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS (EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED
					HEREIN)
					AND THE COMPANY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES AND
					CONDITIONS,
					INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
					PARTICULAR
					PURPOSE, AVAILABILITY, ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED OPERATION, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM A
					COURSE
					OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY MAY NOT, AS A
					MATTER OF APPLICABLE LAW, DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION, THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF SUCH
					WARRANTY OR CONDITION SHALL BE APPLIED TO THE MINIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER SUCH APPLICABLE
					LAW.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>4.2. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL,
					INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
					OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OF ANY TYPE OR NATURE HOWEVER ARISING, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, EXEMPLARY
					OR
					PUNITIVE DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES, OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
					THE
					TOKENS OR THE XAI NETWORK, WHETHER OR NOT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES HAS BEEN DISCLOSED TO OR
					COULD
					HAVE BEEN REASONABLY FORESEEN BY YOU, REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR
					OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED. IN ADDITION, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE COMPANY'S
					AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THESE TERMS EXCEED ONE-HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100.00).</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>4.3. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR
					THE LIMITATION OR
					EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS
					SET
					FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE TOKENS, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
					REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE TOKENS.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h3><b>5. Indemnification</b></h3>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>5.1. You agree, at your own expense, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
					the Company and its
					partners and affiliates and their respective owners, members, agents, directors, officers,
					employees,
					representatives, affiliates, successors, and assigns against any claim, suit, action, or other
					proceeding from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including
					reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees, arising out of or in connection with your breach of these
					Terms, your violation of any law or regulation, or your use of the Tokens. You agree to pay any and
					all
					costs, damages, and expenses, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs
					awarded
					against or otherwise incurred by or in connection with or arising from any such claim, suit, action,
					or
					proceeding attributable to any such claim. The Company reserves the right, at its own expense, to
					assume
					the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in
					which
					event you will fully cooperate with the Company in asserting any available defense.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>5.2. If you have a dispute with one or more users of the Node Software or
					other third parties,
					you release the Company (and its affiliates and service providers, and each of their officers,
					directors, agents, joint ventures, employees, and representatives) from all claims, demands, and
					damages
					(actual and consequential) of every kind and nature arising out of or in any way connected with such
					disputes.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h3><b>6. Dispute Resolution; Agreement to Arbitrate</b></h3>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>6.1. All disputes, claims, and controversies, whether based on past,
					present, or future events,
					arising out of or relating to statutory or common law claims, the breach, termination, enforcement,
					interpretation, or validity of any provision of these Terms, and the determination of the scope or
					applicability of your agreement to arbitrate any dispute, claim, or controversy originating from
					these
					Terms, will be determined by binding arbitration in Tortola, the British Virgin Islands pursuant to
					the
					BVI IAC Arbitration Rules, before a single arbitrator.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>6.2. The arbitrator will apply the substantive law of the British Virgin
					Islands, excluding its
					conflict or choice of law rules.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>6.3. Nothing in these Terms will preclude the parties from seeking
					provisional remedies in aid of
					arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>6.4. A party must notify the other party of its intent to commence
					arbitration prior to
					commencing arbitration. The notice must specify the date on which the arbitration demand is intended
					to
					be filed, which must be at least thirty (30) days after the date of the notice. During this time
					period,
					the parties will meet for the purpose of resolving the dispute prior to commencing
					arbitration.
				</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>6.5. Subject to Section 6.4, each party may commence arbitration by
					providing to the BVI
					International Arbitration Centre and the other party to the dispute a written demand for
					arbitration,
					stating the subject of the dispute and the relief requested. 6.4, each party may commence
					arbitration by
					providing to the BVI International Arbitration Centre and the other party to the dispute a written
					demand for arbitration, stating the subject of the dispute and the relief requested.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>6.6. Subject to the disclaimers and limitations of liability stated in these
					Terms, the appointed
					arbitrators may award monetary damages and any other remedies allowed by the laws of the British
					Virgin
					Islands (including the BVI IAC Arbitration Rules). In making a determination, the arbitrator will
					not
					have the authority to modify any term of these Terms. The arbitrator will deliver a reasoned,
					written
					decision with respect to the dispute to each party, who will promptly act in accordance with the
					arbitrator’s decision. Any award (including interim or final remedies) may be confirmed in or
					enforced
					by a state or federal court located in the British Virgin Islands. The decision of the arbitrator
					will
					be final and binding on the parties, and will not be subject to appeal or review.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>6.7. The party initiating the arbitration is responsible for paying the
					applicable filing fee.
					Each party will advance one-half of the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, the costs of the
					attendance
					of the arbitration reporter at the arbitration hearing and the costs of the arbitration facility. In
					any
					arbitration arising out of or relating to these Terms, the arbitrator will award to the prevailing
					party, if any, the costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in
					connection
					with those aspects of its claims or defenses on which it prevails, and any opposing awards of costs
					and
					legal fees awards will be offset.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>6.8. The parties will keep confidential the existence of the arbitration,
					the arbitration
					proceeding, the hearing and the arbitrator’s decision, except (a) as necessary to prepare for and
					conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits; (b) in connection with a court application for a
					preliminary remedy, or confirmation of an arbitrator’s decision or its enforcement; (c) the Company
					may
					disclose the arbitrator’s decision in confidential settlement negotiations; (d) each party may
					disclose
					as necessary to professional advisors that are subject to a strict duty of confidentiality; and (e)
					as
					applicable law otherwise requires. The parties, witnesses and arbitrator will treat as confidential
					and
					will not disclose to any third person (other than witnesses or experts) any documentary or other
					evidence produced in any arbitration, except as applicable so requires or if the evidence was
					obtained
					from the public domain or was otherwise obtained independently from the arbitration.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>6.9. In the case of a conflict between the provisions of this Section 6 and
					the BVI IAC
					Arbitration Rules, the provisions of this Section 6 shall prevail.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>6.10. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any dispute arising out of
					or relating to these
					Terms, whether in arbitration or in court, shall be conducted only on an individual basis and not in
					a
					class, consolidated or representative action. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms or
					the
					BVI IAC Arbitration Rules, disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of
					this class waiver may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. If this waiver of class
					or
					consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither party is entitled to
					arbitration.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>6.11. If for any reason a claim or dispute proceeds in court rather than
					through arbitration,
					each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or
					counterclaim arising out of or relating to these Terms.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h3><b>7. Term; Termination.</b></h3>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>7.1. These Terms are effective beginning when you accept these Terms or
					first claim, access or
					use the Tokens and ending when terminated as set forth in Section 7.2.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>7.2. Your right to claim, use and access the Tokens will automatically
					terminate in the event you
					fail to comply with any of the terms and conditions of these Terms. Termination will be effective
					without notice.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>7.3. Upon termination of these Terms, you must immediately cease all use of

				<p>8.4 <u>Waivers</u>. For a waiver to be deemed effective, a waiver must be in

					parties under these
					Terms are cumulative, and each party may exercise any of its rights and enforce any of its remedies
					under these Terms, along with all other rights and remedies available to it at law, in equity or

				</p>

				<p>8.6 <u>Severability</u>. If any provision of these Terms is declared to be

					by
					law.</p>

					void.
					The Company reserves the right to freely transfer or assign these Terms and the rights and
					obligations
					hereunder to any third party at any time without your consent and prior notice to you. If you object
					to
					any such transfer or assignment, you may stop using the Node Software.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>8.9 <u>Relationship of the Parties</u>. Nothing contained in these Terms

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>8.11 <u>Entire Agreement</u>. These Terms constitute the entire agreement
					and understanding
					between you and the Company, and supersedes all previous communications, representations or
					agreements,
					whether written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof.</p>
