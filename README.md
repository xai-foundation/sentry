 # Sentry Code Repository

 This repository, named Sentry, is part of the Xai Foundation's infrastructure. It contains the codebase for various components, including:

 - **Sentry Nodes**: These nodes form the backbone of our network, ensuring secure and efficient communication. The repository includes smart contracts for running the rewards system for these Sentry Nodes.
 - **Challenger**: This component is responsible for challenging any suspicious activity on the network.
 - **Desktop and Web GUIs**: These graphical user interfaces allow users to interact with our network in a user-friendly manner.

 All of these components are designed to work together to provide a robust and secure infrastructure for the Xai Foundation. They are also designed to support our GitBook, which provides comprehensive documentation on how to use and interact with our network. You can access the GitBook at the following URL: https://xai-foundation.gitbook.io/
